<!-- First, we need to add the React library as two script tags to the head of our HTML document -->
<script
    src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"
    crossorigin
></script>
<script
    src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    crossorigin
></script>

<!-- Next, we need to add another script, to enable the use of JSX. -->
<!-- JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript, and it is recommended to be used with React. -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
